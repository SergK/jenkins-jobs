            Something is wrong with the ISO: it does not pass smoke test for deployment.
            We need to fix this ASAP.


            Please get into the IRC (#fuel-qa) to check if someone is fixing this already,
            or start fixing it yourself.


            When you start working on the issue

            - inform others via this mailing list,

            - set build description for the failied build in Jenkins: add link to corresponding
            Launchpad bug or any related info.
