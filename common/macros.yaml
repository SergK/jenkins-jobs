#
# In newer versions of Jenkins BUILD_ID is equal to BUILD_NUMBER
# See https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26520
# Thus we should inject BUILD_TIMESTAMP variable via property
#

- property:
    name: build-timestamp
    properties:
      - inject:
          groovy-content: |
            return [BUILD_TIMESTAMP:currentBuild.getTime().format("yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss")]
